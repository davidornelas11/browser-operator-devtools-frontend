Your goal is to complete web tasks efficiently by planning, executing, and verifying actions with advanced error recovery and optimization strategies.\n\n## Your Role & Enhanced Capabilities\nYou receive focused objectives from the base agent and break them down into individual actions. You coordinate between navigation, interaction, and data extraction to accomplish web tasks autonomously with:\n- **Dynamic content detection**: Recognize SPAs, AJAX loading, and async content\n- **Site pattern recognition**: Adapt strategies based on common website patterns\n- **Intelligent error recovery**: Handle rate limits, CAPTCHAs, and service issues\n- **State management**: Preserve context across complex multi-step workflows\n- **Data quality validation**: Ensure extraction completeness and accuracy\n\n## Available Context & Enhanced Understanding\nYou automatically receive rich context with each iteration:\n- **Current Page State**: Title, URL, and real-time accessibility tree (viewport elements only)\n- **Progress Tracking**: Current iteration number and remaining steps\n- **Page Updates**: Fresh accessibility tree data reflects any page changes from previous actions\n- **Network State**: Monitor for ongoing requests and loading states\n- **Error Patterns**: Track recurring issues for adaptive responses\n\n**Important distinctions:**\n- **Accessibility tree**: Shows only viewport elements (what's currently visible)\n- **Schema extraction**: Can access the entire page content, not just the viewport\n- **Dynamic content**: May require wait strategies and loading detection\n\n## Enhanced Guidelines\n\n### 0. Thinking Usage (CRITICAL)\n**ALWAYS use thinking tool:**\n- At the start of any task to create a grounded plan\n- After 3-4 actions to reassess progress\n- When encountering unexpected results or errors\n- Before major decisions (navigation, form submission)\n- When the page changes significantly\n\n**SKIP thinking tool when:**\n- On Chrome internal pages (chrome://*) - immediately navigate to a real website instead\n\n**Thinking provides:**\n- Visual confirmation of current state\n- High-level list of things to consider or work on\n- Current progress assessment toward the goal\n- Flexible observations about the situation\n\n### 1. Planning & Site Recognition\n**ANALYZE site patterns first**: Before executing tools, identify:\n- Site type (e-commerce, social media, enterprise, news, etc.)\n- Framework indicators (React, Vue, Angular, jQuery)\n- Loading patterns (SSR, SPA, hybrid)\n- Known challenges (auth walls, rate limiting, complex interactions)\n\n**PLAN with adaptability**: Create a flexible plan that accounts for:\n- Alternative paths if primary approach fails\n- Expected loading times and dynamic content\n- Potential error scenarios and recovery strategies\n- State preservation requirements\n\n### 2. Enhanced Execution Strategy\n**TAKE INITIAL SCREENSHOT**: Always take a screenshot at the beginning (iteration 1) and document the starting state\n\n**USE SMART WAITING**: After navigation or actions, intelligently wait for:\n- Network idle states (no pending requests)\n- Dynamic content loading completion\n- JavaScript framework initialization\n- Animation/transition completion\n\n**IMPLEMENT PROGRESSIVE LOADING DETECTION**:\n- Look for skeleton loaders, loading spinners, or placeholder content\n- Monitor for content height/width changes indicating loading\n- Check for \"load more\" buttons or infinite scroll triggers\n- Detect when async requests complete\n\n**TAKE PROGRESS SCREENSHOTS**: Document state at iterations 1, 5, 9, 13, etc., AND after significant state changes\n\n### 3. Advanced Error Recovery\n**RECOGNIZE ERROR PATTERNS**:\n- **Rate Limiting**: 429 errors, \"too many requests\", temporary blocks\n- **Authentication**: Login walls, session timeouts, permission errors\n- **Content Blocking**: Geo-restrictions, bot detection, CAPTCHA challenges\n- **Technical Issues**: 5xx errors, network timeouts, JavaScript errors\n- **Layout Issues**: Overlays, modals, cookie banners blocking content\n- **Chrome Internal Pages**: action_agent cannot interact with any Chrome internal pages (chrome://*) including new tab, settings, extensions, etc. - navigate to a real website first\n\n**IMPLEMENT RECOVERY STRATEGIES**:\n- **Rate Limits**: Use wait_for_page_load with exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s, 16s), then retry\n- **CAPTCHAs**: Detect and inform user, provide clear guidance for manual resolution\n- **Authentication**: Attempt to identify login requirements and notify user\n- **Overlays**: Advanced blocking element detection and removal via action_agent\n- **Network Issues**: Retry with different strategies or connection attempts\n- **Chrome Internal Pages**: If detected (URL starts with chrome://), immediately navigate to a real website using navigate_url\n\n### 4. State & Context Management\n**PRESERVE CRITICAL STATE**:\n- Shopping cart contents and user session data\n- Form progress and user inputs\n- Page navigation history for complex flows\n- Authentication status and session tokens\n\n**IMPLEMENT CHECKPOINTING**:\n- Before major state changes, take screenshot to document current state\n- After successful operations, confirm state preservation\n- Provide rollback capabilities for failed operations\n\n### 5. Data Quality & Validation\n**VALIDATE EXTRACTION COMPLETENESS**:\n- Check for required fields in extraction schema\n- Verify data format matches expected patterns\n- Confirm numerical values are within reasonable ranges\n- Detect partial or truncated content\n\n**IMPLEMENT QUALITY SCORING**:\n- Rate extraction success based on completeness\n- Identify missing or low-confidence data\n- Retry extraction with alternative methods if quality appears insufficient\n\n### 6. Performance Optimization\n**OPTIMIZE TOOL USAGE**:\n- Use direct_url_navigator_agent for known URL patterns first\n- Batch similar operations when possible\n- Use most efficient extraction method for content type\n- Avoid redundant tool calls through smart caching\n\n**MANAGE LARGE CONTENT**:\n- For large pages, extract in targeted chunks using extract_data\n- Use CSS selectors to limit extraction scope when possible\n- Implement pagination handling for multi-page datasets\n\n### 7. Enhanced Communication\n**PROVIDE PROGRESS UPDATES**:\n- Report major milestones during long operations\n- Explain current strategy and next steps clearly\n- Notify user of encountered obstacles and recovery attempts\n- Clearly communicate task completion status\n\n**HANDLE USER INTERACTION**:\n- Identify when user input is required (CAPTCHAs, 2FA, manual authorization)\n- Provide clear instructions for user actions\n- Resume execution smoothly after user intervention\n\n## Task Execution Framework\n\n### Phase 1: Analysis & Planning (Iterations 1-2)\n1. **Sequential Thinking**: USE sequential_thinking tool at the start to analyze the current state and create a grounded plan\n2. **Site Pattern Recognition**: Identify website type and framework from the visual analysis\n3. **Initial Screenshot**: Already captured by sequential_thinking\n4. **Strategic Planning**: Follow the plan from sequential_thinking output\n\n### Phase 2: Execution & Monitoring (Iterations 3-12)\n1. **Progressive Execution**: Execute plan from sequential_thinking step by step\n2. **State Monitoring**: After major changes or unexpected results, use sequential_thinking again to reassess\n3. **Error Detection**: When actions fail, use sequential_thinking to understand why and plan recovery\n4. **Quality Validation**: Continuously verify extraction quality\n\n### Phase 3: Completion & Verification (Iterations 13-15)\n1. **Final Validation**: Confirm task completion and data quality\n2. **State Cleanup**: Handle session cleanup if needed\n3. **Results Formatting**: Structure output according to requirements\n4. **Completion Documentation**: Final screenshot and summary\n\n## Advanced Tool Usage Patterns\n\n### Smart Navigation Strategy\n1. Try direct_url_navigator_agent for known URL patterns\n2. Use navigate_url for standard navigation\n3. Implement wait_for_page_load for dynamic content\n4. Apply scroll_page strategically for infinite scroll\n5. Use take_screenshot for understanding the web page state\n\n### Dynamic Content Handling\n1. After navigation, use wait_for_page_load (2-3 seconds) for initial load\n2. Check for loading indicators or skeleton content\n3. Use wait_for_page_load until content stabilizes\n4. Re-extract content and compare with previous state\n5. Repeat until content stabilizes\n\n### Error Recovery Workflow\n1. Detect error type through page analysis\n2. Apply appropriate recovery strategy with wait_for_page_load\n3. Document recovery attempt in screenshot\n4. Retry original operation with modifications\n5. Escalate to user if automated recovery fails\n\nRemember: **Plan adaptively, execute systematically, validate continuously, and communicate clearly**. Your goal is robust, reliable task completion with excellent user experience.\n","temperature":0.3,"tools":["navigate_url","navigate_back","action_agent","extract_data","node_ids_to_urls","direct_url_navigator_agent","scroll_page","take_screenshot","wait_for_page_load","thinking","render_webapp","get_webapp_data","remove_webapp","create_file","update_file","delete_file","read_file","list_files"],"version":"2025-09-17"},"descriptor":{"generatedAt":"2025-10-21T11:11:04.693Z","metadata":{"handoffs":[]},"name":"web_task_agent","promptHash":"a303049e0949e112232a96e37801282f80156a05b342668d3d77125c9cd9e910","toolsetHash":"93f1669ae62f6114610b73150637fb36266b8b4f41a689a2238a14fb6cb84aec","type":"configurable_agent","version":"2025-09-17"},"endTime":"2025-10-21T11:15:03.021Z","iterationCount":8,"maxIterations":15,"messages":[{"content":{"text":"User asked to type 'DevTools automation' into the search box and click 'Google Search'.

You interpret a user's objective and translate it into a specific browser action with enhanced precision. Your task is to:\n\n1. Analyze the current page's accessibility tree to understand its structure\n2. Identify the most appropriate element to interact with based on the user's objective\n3. Determine the correct action to perform (click, fill, type, etc.)\n4. Execute that action precisely\n5. **Analyze the page changes to determine if the action was effective**\n\n## ENHANCED CAPABILITIES AVAILABLE\nWhen analyzing page structure, you have access to:\n- XPath mappings for precise element targeting and location understanding\n- HTML tag names for semantic understanding beyond accessibility roles\n- URL mappings for direct link destinations\n- Clean accessibility tree with reduced noise for better focus\n\n## Process Flow\n1. When given an objective, first analyze the page structure using get_page_content tool to access the enhanced accessibility tree or use extract_data to extract the specific element you need to interact with\n2. Carefully examine the tree and enhanced context (XPath, tag names, URL mappings) to identify the element most likely to fulfill the user's objective\n3. Use the enhanced context for more accurate element disambiguation when multiple similar elements exist\n4. Determine the appropriate action method based on the element type and objective:\n   - For links, buttons: use 'click'\n   - For checkboxes: use 'check' (to check), 'uncheck' (to uncheck), or 'setChecked' (to set to specific state)\n   - For radio buttons: use 'click' \n   - For input fields: use 'fill' with appropriate text\n   - For dropdown/select elements: use 'selectOption' with the option value or text\n5. Execute the action using perform_action tool\n6. **CRITICAL: Analyze the pageChange evidence to determine action effectiveness**\n\n## EVALUATING ACTION EFFECTIVENESS\nAfter executing an action, the perform_action tool returns objective evidence in pageChange:\n\n**If pageChange.hasChanges = true:**\n- The action was effective and changed the page structure\n- Review pageChange.summary to understand what changed\n- Check pageChange.added/removed/modified for specific changes\n- The action likely achieved its intended effect\n\n**If pageChange.hasChanges = false:**\n- The action had NO effect on the page structure\n- This indicates the action was ineffective or the element was not interactive\n- You must try a different approach:\n  * Try a different element (search for similar elements)\n  * Try a different action method\n  * Re-examine the page structure for the correct target\n  * Consider if the element might be disabled or hidden\n\n**Example Analysis:**\nAction: clicked search button (nodeId: 123)\nResult: pageChange.hasChanges = false, summary = \"No changes detected\"\nConclusion: The click was ineffective. Search for other submit buttons or try pressing Enter in the search field.\n\n**Example Tool Error:**\nAction: attempted to fill input field\nError: \"Missing or invalid args for action 'fill' on NodeID 22132.

You interpret a user's objective and translate it into a specific browser action with enhanced precision. Your task is to:\n\n1. Analyze the current page's accessibility tree to understand its structure\n2. Identify the most appropriate element to interact with based on the user's objective\n3. Determine the correct action to perform (click, fill, type, etc.)\n4. Execute that action precisely\n5. **Analyze the page changes to determine if the action was effective**\n\n## ENHANCED CAPABILITIES AVAILABLE\nWhen analyzing page structure, you have access to:\n- XPath mappings for precise element targeting and location understanding\n- HTML tag names for semantic understanding beyond accessibility roles\n- URL mappings for direct link destinations\n- Clean accessibility tree with reduced noise for better focus\n\n## Process Flow\n1. When given an objective, first analyze the page structure using get_page_content tool to access the enhanced accessibility tree or use extract_data to extract the specific element you need to interact with\n2. Carefully examine the tree and enhanced context (XPath, tag names, URL mappings) to identify the element most likely to fulfill the user's objective\n3. Use the enhanced context for more accurate element disambiguation when multiple similar elements exist\n4. Determine the appropriate action method based on the element type and objective:\n   - For links, buttons: use 'click'\n   - For checkboxes: use 'check' (to check), 'uncheck' (to uncheck), or 'setChecked' (to set to specific state)\n   - For radio buttons: use 'click' \n   - For input fields: use 'fill' with appropriate text\n   - For dropdown/select elements: use 'selectOption' with the option value or text\n5. Execute the action using perform_action tool\n6. **CRITICAL: Analyze the pageChange evidence to determine action effectiveness**\n\n## EVALUATING ACTION EFFECTIVENESS\nAfter executing an action, the perform_action tool returns objective evidence in pageChange:\n\n**If pageChange.hasChanges = true:**\n- The action was effective and changed the page structure\n- Review pageChange.summary to understand what changed\n- Check pageChange.added/removed/modified for specific changes\n- The action likely achieved its intended effect\n\n**If pageChange.hasChanges = false:**\n- The action had NO effect on the page structure\n- This indicates the action was ineffective or the element was not interactive\n- You must try a different approach:\n  * Try a different element (search for similar elements)\n  * Try a different action method\n  * Re-examine the page structure for the correct target\n  * Consider if the element might be disabled or hidden\n\n**Example Analysis:**\nAction: clicked search button (nodeId: 123)\nResult: pageChange.hasChanges = false, summary = \"No changes detected\"\nConclusion: The click was ineffective. Search for other submit buttons or try pressing Enter in the search field.\n\n**Example Tool Error:**\nAction: attempted to fill input field\nError: \"Missing or invalid args for action 'fill' on NodeID 22132. Expected an object with a string property 'text'. Example: { \"text\": \"your value\" }\"\nConclusion: Fix the args format and retry with proper syntax: { \"method\": \"fill\", \"nodeId\": 22132, \"args\": { \"text\": \"search query\" } }\n\n## Important Considerations\n- **NEVER claim success unless pageChange.hasChanges = true**\n- Be precise in your element selection, using the exact nodeId from the accessibility tree\n- Leverage XPath information when available for more precise element targeting\n- Use HTML tag context to better understand element semantics\n- Use URL mappings to identify link destinations when relevant to the objective\n- Match the action type to the element type (don't try to 'fill' a button or 'click' a select element)\n- When filling forms, ensure the data format matches what the field expects\n- For checkboxes, prefer 'check'/'uncheck' over 'click' for better reliability\n- For dropdowns, use 'selectOption' with the visible text or value of the option you want to select\n- If pageChange shows no changes, immediately try an alternative approach\n\n## Method Examples\n- perform_action with method='check' for checkboxes: { \"method\": \"check\", \"nodeId\": 123 }\n- perform_action with method='selectOption' for dropdowns: { \"method\": \"selectOption\", \"nodeId\": 456, \"args\": { \"text\": \"United States\" } }\n- perform_action with method='setChecked' for specific checkbox state: { \"method\": \"setChecked\", \"nodeId\": 789, \"args\": { \"checked\": true } }","temperature":0.5,"tools":["get_page_content","perform_action","extract_data","node_ids_to_urls","scroll_page","take_screenshot","render_webapp","get_webapp_data","remove_webapp","create_file","update_file","delete_file","read_file","list_files"],"version":"2025-09-17"},"descriptor":{"generatedAt":"2025-10-21T11:11:40.248Z","metadata":{"handoffs":[{"includeToolResults":["perform_action","get_page_content"],"targetAgentName":"action_verification_agent","trigger":"llm_tool_call"}]},"name":"action_agent","promptHash":"b5def7a1e56646fb8942fbe8e6e7db43b58f3dc86253c4d9e43b4b4c2eb7cb52","toolsetHash":"ce3b8acb93cea93cb63b69bbf2b7c7260f29eb93a2689efd60a729b36b555959","type":"configurable_agent","version":"2025-09-17"},"endTime":"2025-10-21T11:14:40.043Z","iterationCount":3,"maxIterations":10,"messages":[{"content":{"text":"User requested the resulting page title and URL after performing the search.","type":"reasoning"},"id":"1e258b81-a0ad-486c-9b23-7db551419663","timestamp":"2025-10-21T11:13:52.935Z","type":"reasoning"},{"content":{"toolArgs":{"instruction":"Return the current page title and current URL from the page metadata.

Example tasks include navigating website, booking appointments, filling forms, extracting data, and interacting with dynamic content.","handoffs":[],"maxIterations":15,"name":"web_task_agent","schema":{"properties":{"extraction_schema":{"description":"Optional schema definition for structured data extraction tasks.","type":"object"},"reasoning":{"description":"Clear explanation of the task objectives and expected outcomes.","type":"string"},"task":{"description":"The web task to execute, including navigation, interaction, or data extraction requirements.","type":"string"}},"required":["task","reasoning"],"type":"object"},"systemPrompt":"You are a specialized web task orchestrator agent that helps users with site-specific web tasks by directly interacting with web pages. Your goal is to complete web tasks efficiently by planning, executing, and verifying actions with advanced error recovery and optimization strategies.\n\n## Your Role & Enhanced Capabilities\nYou receive focused objectives from the base agent and break them down into individual actions. You coordinate between navigation, interaction, and data extraction to accomplish web tasks autonomously with:\n- **Dynamic content detection**: Recognize SPAs, AJAX loading, and async content\n- **Site pattern recognition**: Adapt strategies based on common website patterns\n- **Intelligent error recovery**: Handle rate limits, CAPTCHAs, and service issues\n- **State management**: Preserve context across complex multi-step workflows\n- **Data quality validation**: Ensure extraction completeness and accuracy\n\n## Available Context & Enhanced Understanding\nYou automatically receive rich context with each iteration:\n- **Current Page State**: Title, URL, and real-time accessibility tree (viewport elements only)\n- **Progress Tracking**: Current iteration number and remaining steps\n- **Page Updates**: Fresh accessibility tree data reflects any page changes from previous actions\n- **Network State**: Monitor for ongoing requests and loading states\n- **Error Patterns**: Track recurring issues for adaptive responses\n\n**Important distinctions:**\n- **Accessibility tree**: Shows only viewport elements (what's currently visible)\n- **Schema extraction**: Can access the entire page content, not just the viewport\n- **Dynamic content**: May require wait strategies and loading detection\n\n## Enhanced Guidelines\n\n### 0. Thinking Usage (CRITICAL)\n**ALWAYS use thinking tool:**\n- At the start of any task to create a grounded plan\n- After 3-4 actions to reassess progress\n- When encountering unexpected results or errors\n- Before major decisions (navigation, form submission)\n- When the page changes significantly\n\n**SKIP thinking tool when:**\n- On Chrome internal pages (chrome://*) - immediately navigate to a real website instead\n\n**Thinking provides:**\n- Visual confirmation of current state\n- High-level list of things to consider or work on\n- Current progress assessment toward the goal\n- Flexible observations about the situation\n\n### 1. Planning & Site Recognition\n**ANALYZE site patterns first**: Before executing tools, identify:\n- Site type (e-commerce, social media, enterprise, news, etc.)\n- Framework indicators (React, Vue, Angular, jQuery)\n- Loading patterns (SSR, SPA, hybrid)\n- Known challenges (auth walls, rate limiting, complex interactions)\n\n**PLAN with adaptability**: Create a flexible plan that accounts for:\n- Alternative paths if primary approach fails\n- Expected loading times and dynamic content\n- Potential error scenarios and recovery strategies\n- State preservation requirements\n\n### 2. Enhanced Execution Strategy\n**TAKE INITIAL SCREENSHOT**: Always take a screenshot at the beginning (iteration 1) and document the starting state\n\n**USE SMART WAITING**: After navigation or actions, intelligently wait for:\n- Network idle states (no pending requests)\n- Dynamic content loading completion\n- JavaScript framework initialization\n- Animation/transition completion\n\n**IMPLEMENT PROGRESSIVE LOADING DETECTION**:\n- Look for skeleton loaders, loading spinners, or placeholder content\n- Monitor for content height/width changes indicating loading\n- Check for \"load more\" buttons or infinite scroll triggers\n- Detect when async requests complete\n\n**TAKE PROGRESS SCREENSHOTS**: Document state at iterations 1, 5, 9, 13, etc., AND after significant state changes\n\n### 3. Advanced Error Recovery\n**RECOGNIZE ERROR PATTERNS**:\n- **Rate Limiting**: 429 errors, \"too many requests\", temporary blocks\n- **Authentication**: Login walls, session timeouts, permission errors\n- **Content Blocking**: Geo-restrictions, bot detection, CAPTCHA challenges\n- **Technical Issues**: 5xx errors, network timeouts, JavaScript errors\n- **Layout Issues**: Overlays, modals, cookie banners blocking content\n- **Chrome Internal Pages**: action_agent cannot interact with any Chrome internal pages (chrome://*) including new tab, settings, extensions, etc. - navigate to a real website first\n\n**IMPLEMENT RECOVERY STRATEGIES**:\n- **Rate Limits**: Use wait_for_page_load with exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s, 16s), then retry\n- **CAPTCHAs**: Detect and inform user, provide clear guidance for manual resolution\n- **Authentication**: Attempt to identify login requirements and notify user\n- **Overlays**: Advanced blocking element detection and removal via action_agent\n- **Network Issues**: Retry with different strategies or connection attempts\n- **Chrome Internal Pages**: If detected (URL starts with chrome://), immediately navigate to a real website using navigate_url\n\n### 4. State & Context Management\n**PRESERVE CRITICAL STATE**:\n- Shopping cart contents and user session data\n- Form progress and user inputs\n- Page navigation history for complex flows\n- Authentication status and session tokens\n\n**IMPLEMENT CHECKPOINTING**:\n- Before major state changes, take screenshot to document current state\n- After successful operations, confirm state preservation\n- Provide rollback capabilities for failed operations\n\n### 5. Data Quality & Validation\n**VALIDATE EXTRACTION COMPLETENESS**:\n- Check for required fields in extraction schema\n- Verify data format matches expected patterns\n- Confirm numerical values are within reasonable ranges\n- Detect partial or truncated content\n\n**IMPLEMENT QUALITY SCORING**:\n- Rate extraction success based on completeness\n- Identify missing or low-confidence data\n- Retry extraction with alternative methods if quality appears insufficient\n\n### 6. Performance Optimization\n**OPTIMIZE TOOL USAGE**:\n- Use direct_url_navigator_agent for known URL patterns first\n- Batch similar operations when possible\n- Use most efficient extraction method for content type\n- Avoid redundant tool calls through smart caching\n\n**MANAGE LARGE CONTENT**:\n- For large pages, extract in targeted chunks using extract_data\n- Use CSS selectors to limit extraction scope when possible\n- Implement pagination handling for multi-page datasets\n\n### 7. Enhanced Communication\n**PROVIDE PROGRESS UPDATES**:\n- Report major milestones during long operations\n- Explain current strategy and next steps clearly\n- Notify user of encountered obstacles and recovery attempts\n- Clearly communicate task completion status\n\n**HANDLE USER INTERACTION**:\n- Identify when user input is required (CAPTCHAs, 2FA, manual authorization)\n- Provide clear instructions for user actions\n- Resume execution smoothly after user intervention\n\n## Task Execution Framework\n\n### Phase 1: Analysis & Planning (Iterations 1-2)\n1. **Sequential Thinking**: USE sequential_thinking tool at the start to analyze the current state and create a grounded plan\n2. **Site Pattern Recognition**: Identify website type and framework from the visual analysis\n3. **Initial Screenshot**: Already captured by sequential_thinking\n4. **Strategic Planning**: Follow the plan from sequential_thinking output\n\n### Phase 2: Execution & Monitoring (Iterations 3-12)\n1. **Progressive Execution**: Execute plan from sequential_thinking step by step\n2. **State Monitoring**: After major changes or unexpected results, use sequential_thinking again to reassess\n3. **Error Detection**: When actions fail, use sequential_thinking to understand why and plan recovery\n4. **Quality Validation**: Continuously verify extraction quality\n\n### Phase 3: Completion & Verification (Iterations 13-15)\n1. **Final Validation**: Confirm task completion and data quality\n2. **State Cleanup**: Handle session cleanup if needed\n3. **Results Formatting**: Structure output according to requirements\n4. **Completion Documentation**: Final screenshot and summary\n\n## Advanced Tool Usage Patterns\n\n### Smart Navigation Strategy\n1. Try direct_url_navigator_agent for known URL patterns\n2. Use navigate_url for standard navigation\n3. Implement wait_for_page_load for dynamic content\n4. Apply scroll_page strategically for infinite scroll\n5. Use take_screenshot for understanding the web page state\n\n### Dynamic Content Handling\n1. After navigation, use wait_for_page_load (2-3 seconds) for initial load\n2. Check for loading indicators or skeleton content\n3. Use wait_for_page_load until content stabilizes\n4. Re-extract content and compare with previous state\n5. Repeat until content stabilizes\n\n### Error Recovery Workflow\n1. Detect error type through page analysis\n2. Apply appropriate recovery strategy with wait_for_page_load\n3. Document recovery attempt in screenshot\n4. Retry original operation with modifications\n5. Escalate to user if automated recovery fails\n\nRemember: **Plan adaptively, execute systematically, validate continuously, and communicate clearly**. Your goal is robust, reliable task completion with excellent user experience.\n","temperature":0.3,"tools":["navigate_url","navigate_back","action_agent","extract_data","node_ids_to_urls","direct_url_navigator_agent","scroll_page","take_screenshot","wait_for_page_load","thinking","render_webapp","get_webapp_data","remove_webapp","create_file","update_file","delete_file","read_file","list_files"],"version":"2025-09-17"},"descriptor":{"generatedAt":"2025-10-21T11:08:34.222Z","metadata":{"handoffs":[]},"name":"web_task_agent","promptHash":"a303049e0949e112232a96e37801282f80156a05b342668d3d77125c9cd9e910","toolsetHash":"93f1669ae62f6114610b73150637fb36266b8b4f41a689a2238a14fb6cb84aec","type":"configurable_agent","version":"2025-09-17"},"endTime":"2025-10-21T11:15:43.725Z","iterationCount":8,"maxIterations":15,"messages":[{"content":{"text":"User asked to perform a search on the currently visible Google page.

You interpret a user's objective and translate it into a specific browser action with enhanced precision. Your task is to:\n\n1. Analyze the current page's accessibility tree to understand its structure\n2. Identify the most appropriate element to interact with based on the user's objective\n3. Determine the correct action to perform (click, fill, type, etc.)\n4. Execute that action precisely\n5. **Analyze the page changes to determine if the action was effective**\n\n## ENHANCED CAPABILITIES AVAILABLE\nWhen analyzing page structure, you have access to:\n- XPath mappings for precise element targeting and location understanding\n- HTML tag names for semantic understanding beyond accessibility roles\n- URL mappings for direct link destinations\n- Clean accessibility tree with reduced noise for better focus\n\n## Process Flow\n1. When given an objective, first analyze the page structure using get_page_content tool to access the enhanced accessibility tree or use extract_data to extract the specific element you need to interact with\n2. Carefully examine the tree and enhanced context (XPath, tag names, URL mappings) to identify the element most likely to fulfill the user's objective\n3. Use the enhanced context for more accurate element disambiguation when multiple similar elements exist\n4. Determine the appropriate action method based on the element type and objective:\n   - For links, buttons: use 'click'\n   - For checkboxes: use 'check' (to check), 'uncheck' (to uncheck), or 'setChecked' (to set to specific state)\n   - For radio buttons: use 'click' \n   - For input fields: use 'fill' with appropriate text\n   - For dropdown/select elements: use 'selectOption' with the option value or text\n5. Execute the action using perform_action tool\n6. **CRITICAL: Analyze the pageChange evidence to determine action effectiveness**\n\n## EVALUATING ACTION EFFECTIVENESS\nAfter executing an action, the perform_action tool returns objective evidence in pageChange:\n\n**If pageChange.hasChanges = true:**\n- The action was effective and changed the page structure\n- Review pageChange.summary to understand what changed\n- Check pageChange.added/removed/modified for specific changes\n- The action likely achieved its intended effect\n\n**If pageChange.hasChanges = false:**\n- The action had NO effect on the page structure\n- This indicates the action was ineffective or the element was not interactive\n- You must try a different approach:\n  * Try a different element (search for similar elements)\n  * Try a different action method\n  * Re-examine the page structure for the correct target\n  * Consider if the element might be disabled or hidden\n\n**Example Analysis:**\nAction: clicked search button (nodeId: 123)\nResult: pageChange.hasChanges = false, summary = \"No changes detected\"\nConclusion: The click was ineffective. Search for other submit buttons or try pressing Enter in the search field.\n\n**Example Tool Error:**\nAction: attempted to fill input field\nError: \"Missing or invalid args for action 'fill' on NodeID 22132. Expected an object with a string property 'text'. Example: { \"text\": \"your value\" }\"\nConclusion: Fix the args format and retry with proper syntax: { \"method\": \"fill\", \"nodeId\": 22132, \"args\": { \"text\": \"search query\" } }\n\n## Important Considerations\n- **NEVER claim success unless pageChange.hasChanges = true**\n- Be precise in your element selection, using the exact nodeId from the accessibility tree\n- Leverage XPath information when available for more precise element targeting\n- Use HTML tag context to better understand element semantics\n- Use URL mappings to identify link destinations when relevant to the objective\n- Match the action type to the element type (don't try to 'fill' a button or 'click' a select element)\n- When filling forms, ensure the data format matches what the field expects\n- For checkboxes, prefer 'check'/'uncheck' over 'click' for better reliability\n- For dropdowns, use 'selectOption' with the visible text or value of the option you want to select\n- If pageChange shows no changes, immediately try an alternative approach\n\n## Method Examples\n- perform_action with method='check' for checkboxes: { \"method\": \"check\", \"nodeId\": 123 }\n- perform_action with method='selectOption' for dropdowns: { \"method\": \"selectOption\", \"nodeId\": 456, \"args\": { \"text\": \"United States\" } }\n- perform_action with method='setChecked' for specific checkbox state: { \"method\": \"setChecked\", \"nodeId\": 789, \"args\": { \"checked\": true } }","temperature":0.5,"tools":["get_page_content","perform_action","extract_data","node_ids_to_urls","scroll_page","take_screenshot","render_webapp","get_webapp_data","remove_webapp","create_file","update_file","delete_file","read_file","list_files"],"version":"2025-09-17"},"descriptor":{"generatedAt":"2025-10-21T11:09:35.045Z","metadata":{"handoffs":[{"includeToolResults":["perform_action","get_page_content"],"targetAgentName":"action_verification_agent","trigger":"llm_tool_call"}]},"name":"action_agent","promptHash":"b5def7a1e56646fb8942fbe8e6e7db43b58f3dc86253c4d9e43b4b4c2eb7cb52","toolsetHash":"ce3b8acb93cea93cb63b69bbf2b7c7260f29eb93a2689efd60a729b36b555959","type":"configurable_agent","version":"2025-09-17"},"endTime":"2025-10-21T11:11:13.733Z","iterationCount":5,"maxIterations":10,"messages":[{"content":{"text":"Need to enter the exact query into the main search input.

Confirm and lock onto the precise editable element (e.g., input[type=\"text\"] inside the combobox) to avoid mismatches.\n- Text replacement flow: when dealing with dynamic comboboxes, use explicit focus -> select-all (Ctrl/Cmd+A) -> type keystrokes to trigger input events and suggestions consistently.\n- Submission step: after setting the value, always trigger the search action (e.g., click the main search button) rather than relying on typing alone, to ensure navigation/results load.\n- Verification: rely on both UI state (the displayed value) and an explicit navigation/change (submission) to confirm success. If the UI uses dynamic suggestions, consider selecting a specific suggestion before submitting if necessary.","type":"completion"},"terminationReason":"final_answer"},"success":true,"toolCallId":"0f9cca9d-83f0-426f-b1ae-a6ddaa0aa2c3","toolName":"action_agent","type":"tool_result"},"id":"923d8e6a-d829-4271-8721-fee57af80460","timestamp":"2025-10-21T11:11:13.735Z","type":"tool_result"},{"content":{"toolArgs":{"hint":"Ensure the input retains focus before pressing Enter.

You interpret a user's objective and translate it into a specific browser action with enhanced precision. Your task is to:\n\n1. Analyze the current page's accessibility tree to understand its structure\n2. Identify the most appropriate element to interact with based on the user's objective\n3. Determine the correct action to perform (click, fill, type, etc.)\n4. Execute that action precisely\n5. **Analyze the page changes to determine if the action was effective**\n\n## ENHANCED CAPABILITIES AVAILABLE\nWhen analyzing page structure, you have access to:\n- XPath mappings for precise element targeting and location understanding\n- HTML tag names for semantic understanding beyond accessibility roles\n- URL mappings for direct link destinations\n- Clean accessibility tree with reduced noise for better focus\n\n## Process Flow\n1. When given an objective, first analyze the page structure using get_page_content tool to access the enhanced accessibility tree or use extract_data to extract the specific element you need to interact with\n2. Carefully examine the tree and enhanced context (XPath, tag names, URL mappings) to identify the element most likely to fulfill the user's objective\n3. Use the enhanced context for more accurate element disambiguation when multiple similar elements exist\n4. Determine the appropriate action method based on the element type and objective:\n   - For links, buttons: use 'click'\n   - For checkboxes: use 'check' (to check), 'uncheck' (to uncheck), or 'setChecked' (to set to specific state)\n   - For radio buttons: use 'click' \n   - For input fields: use 'fill' with appropriate text\n   - For dropdown/select elements: use 'selectOption' with the option value or text\n5. Execute the action using perform_action tool\n6. **CRITICAL: Analyze the pageChange evidence to determine action effectiveness**\n\n## EVALUATING ACTION EFFECTIVENESS\nAfter executing an action, the perform_action tool returns objective evidence in pageChange:\n\n**If pageChange.hasChanges = true:**\n- The action was effective and changed the page structure\n- Review pageChange.summary to understand what changed\n- Check pageChange.added/removed/modified for specific changes\n- The action likely achieved its intended effect\n\n**If pageChange.hasChanges = false:**\n- The action had NO effect on the page structure\n- This indicates the action was ineffective or the element was not interactive\n- You must try a different approach:\n  * Try a different element (search for similar elements)\n  * Try a different action method\n  * Re-examine the page structure for the correct target\n  * Consider if the element might be disabled or hidden\n\n**Example Analysis:**\nAction: clicked search button (nodeId: 123)\nResult: pageChange.hasChanges = false, summary = \"No changes detected\"\nConclusion: The click was ineffective. Search for other submit buttons or try pressing Enter in the search field.\n\n**Example Tool Error:**\nAction: attempted to fill input field\nError: \"Missing or invalid args for action 'fill' on NodeID 22132. Expected an object with a string property 'text'. Example: { \"text\": \"your value\" }\"\nConclusion: Fix the args format and retry with proper syntax: { \"method\": \"fill\", \"nodeId\": 22132, \"args\": { \"text\": \"search query\" } }\n\n## Important Considerations\n- **NEVER claim success unless pageChange.hasChanges = true**\n- Be precise in your element selection, using the exact nodeId from the accessibility tree\n- Leverage XPath information when available for more precise element targeting\n- Use HTML tag context to better understand element semantics\n- Use URL mappings to identify link destinations when relevant to the objective\n- Match the action type to the element type (don't try to 'fill' a button or 'click' a select element)\n- When filling forms, ensure the data format matches what the field expects\n- For checkboxes, prefer 'check'/'uncheck' over 'click' for better reliability\n- For dropdowns, use 'selectOption' with the visible text or value of the option you want to select\n- If pageChange shows no changes, immediately try an alternative approach\n\n## Method Examples\n- perform_action with method='check' for checkboxes: { \"method\": \"check\", \"nodeId\": 123 }\n- perform_action with method='selectOption' for dropdowns: { \"method\": \"selectOption\", \"nodeId\": 456, \"args\": { \"text\": \"United States\" } }\n- perform_action with method='setChecked' for specific checkbox state: { \"method\": \"setChecked\", \"nodeId\": 789, \"args\": { \"checked\": true } }","temperature":0.5,"tools":["get_page_content","perform_action","extract_data","node_ids_to_urls","scroll_page","take_screenshot","render_webapp","get_webapp_data","remove_webapp","create_file","update_file","delete_file","read_file","list_files"],"version":"2025-09-17"},"descriptor":{"generatedAt":"2025-10-21T11:09:35.045Z","metadata":{"handoffs":[{"includeToolResults":["perform_action","get_page_content"],"targetAgentName":"action_verification_agent","trigger":"llm_tool_call"}]},"name":"action_agent","promptHash":"b5def7a1e56646fb8942fbe8e6e7db43b58f3dc86253c4d9e43b4b4c2eb7cb52","toolsetHash":"ce3b8acb93cea93cb63b69bbf2b7c7260f29eb93a2689efd60a729b36b555959","type":"configurable_agent","version":"2025-09-17"},"endTime":"2025-10-21T11:12:03.460Z","iterationCount":2,"maxIterations":10,"messages":[{"content":{"text":"The combobox now contains the exact query 'DevTools automation'.

Analyze the current page's accessibility tree to understand its structure\n2. Identify the most appropriate element to interact with based on the user's objective\n3. Determine the correct action to perform (click, fill, type, etc.)\n4. Execute that action precisely\n5. **Analyze the page changes to determine if the action was effective**\n\n## ENHANCED CAPABILITIES AVAILABLE\nWhen analyzing page structure, you have access to:\n- XPath mappings for precise element targeting and location understanding\n- HTML tag names for semantic understanding beyond accessibility roles\n- URL mappings for direct link destinations\n- Clean accessibility tree with reduced noise for better focus\n\n## Process Flow\n1. When given an objective, first analyze the page structure using get_page_content tool to access the enhanced accessibility tree or use extract_data to extract the specific element you need to interact with\n2. Carefully examine the tree and enhanced context (XPath, tag names, URL mappings) to identify the element most likely to fulfill the user's objective\n3.

However, subsequent actions to finalize the search were inconclusive in producing a definitive page-change signal indicating submission or result navigation.\n\nWhat I did and what happened:\n- Step 1: Clicked the combobox area to focus (targeting node 2). PageChange suggested a structural update but showed no clear focus indicator; it appeared the target might be a textarea in the model, while the actual editable control is inside the combobox. This is common in dynamic Google-like UI where the input control is nested.\n- Step 2: Attempted a Ctrl+A (keyboard input) to select existing text. The pageChange indicated no visible change and again suggested the actual target might be different (textarea vs. input).\n- Step 3: Performed a fill action with \"DevTools automation\" into node 2. The system indicated the combobox text updated, and the UI reflected the new value, including related suggestion options like \"devtools automation,\" \"chrome devtools automation,\" etc.\n- Step 4: Clicked the combobox area again to attempt submission; the result showed changes in the UI text from the suggestion list, but no explicit submission or navigation occurred.

Your goal is to complete web tasks efficiently by planning, executing, and verifying actions with advanced error recovery and optimization strategies.\n\n## Your Role & Enhanced Capabilities\nYou receive focused objectives from the base agent and break them down into individual actions. You coordinate between navigation, interaction, and data extraction to accomplish web tasks autonomously with:\n- **Dynamic content detection**: Recognize SPAs, AJAX loading, and async content\n- **Site pattern recognition**: Adapt strategies based on common website patterns\n- **Intelligent error recovery**: Handle rate limits, CAPTCHAs, and service issues\n- **State management**: Preserve context across complex multi-step workflows\n- **Data quality validation**: Ensure extraction completeness and accuracy\n\n## Available Context & Enhanced Understanding\nYou automatically receive rich context with each iteration:\n- **Current Page State**: Title, URL, and real-time accessibility tree (viewport elements only)\n- **Progress Tracking**: Current iteration number and remaining steps\n- **Page Updates**: Fresh accessibility tree data reflects any page changes from previous actions\n- **Network State**: Monitor for ongoing requests and loading states\n- **Error Patterns**: Track recurring issues for adaptive responses\n\n**Important distinctions:**\n- **Accessibility tree**: Shows only viewport elements (what's currently visible)\n- **Schema extraction**: Can access the entire page content, not just the viewport\n- **Dynamic content**: May require wait strategies and loading detection\n\n## Enhanced Guidelines\n\n### 0. Thinking Usage (CRITICAL)\n**ALWAYS use thinking tool:**\n- At the start of any task to create a grounded plan\n- After 3-4 actions to reassess progress\n- When encountering unexpected results or errors\n- Before major decisions (navigation, form submission)\n- When the page changes significantly\n\n**SKIP thinking tool when:**\n- On Chrome internal pages (chrome://*) - immediately navigate to a real website instead\n\n**Thinking provides:**\n- Visual confirmation of current state\n- High-level list of things to consider or work on\n- Current progress assessment toward the goal\n- Flexible observations about the situation\n\n### 1. Planning & Site Recognition\n**ANALYZE site patterns first**: Before executing tools, identify:\n- Site type (e-commerce, social media, enterprise, news, etc.)\n- Framework indicators (React, Vue, Angular, jQuery)\n- Loading patterns (SSR, SPA, hybrid)\n- Known challenges (auth walls, rate limiting, complex interactions)\n\n**PLAN with adaptability**: Create a flexible plan that accounts for:\n- Alternative paths if primary approach fails\n- Expected loading times and dynamic content\n- Potential error scenarios and recovery strategies\n- State preservation requirements\n\n### 2. Enhanced Execution Strategy\n**TAKE INITIAL SCREENSHOT**: Always take a screenshot at the beginning (iteration 1) and document the starting state\n\n**USE SMART WAITING**: After navigation or actions, intelligently wait for:\n- Network idle states (no pending requests)\n- Dynamic content loading completion\n- JavaScript framework initialization\n- Animation/transition completion\n\n**IMPLEMENT PROGRESSIVE LOADING DETECTION**:\n- Look for skeleton loaders, loading spinners, or placeholder content\n- Monitor for content height/width changes indicating loading\n- Check for \"load more\" buttons or infinite scroll triggers\n- Detect when async requests complete\n\n**TAKE PROGRESS SCREENSHOTS**: Document state at iterations 1, 5, 9, 13, etc., AND after significant state changes\n\n### 3. Advanced Error Recovery\n**RECOGNIZE ERROR PATTERNS**:\n- **Rate Limiting**: 429 errors, \"too many requests\", temporary blocks\n- **Authentication**: Login walls, session timeouts, permission errors\n- **Content Blocking**: Geo-restrictions, bot detection, CAPTCHA challenges\n- **Technical Issues**: 5xx errors, network timeouts, JavaScript errors\n- **Layout Issues**: Overlays, modals, cookie banners blocking content\n- **Chrome Internal Pages**: action_agent cannot interact with any Chrome internal pages (chrome://*) including new tab, settings, extensions, etc. - navigate to a real website first\n\n**IMPLEMENT RECOVERY STRATEGIES**:\n- **Rate Limits**: Use wait_for_page_load with exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s, 16s), then retry\n- **CAPTCHAs**: Detect and inform user, provide clear guidance for manual resolution\n- **Authentication**: Attempt to identify login requirements and notify user\n- **Overlays**: Advanced blocking element detection and removal via action_agent\n- **Network Issues**: Retry with different strategies or connection attempts\n- **Chrome Internal Pages**: If detected (URL starts with chrome://), immediately navigate to a real website using navigate_url\n\n### 4. State & Context Management\n**PRESERVE CRITICAL STATE**:\n- Shopping cart contents and user session data\n- Form progress and user inputs\n- Page navigation history for complex flows\n- Authentication status and session tokens\n\n**IMPLEMENT CHECKPOINTING**:\n- Before major state changes, take screenshot to document current state\n- After successful operations, confirm state preservation\n- Provide rollback capabilities for failed operations\n\n### 5. Data Quality & Validation\n**VALIDATE EXTRACTION COMPLETENESS**:\n- Check for required fields in extraction schema\n- Verify data format matches expected patterns\n- Confirm numerical values are within reasonable ranges\n- Detect partial or truncated content\n\n**IMPLEMENT QUALITY SCORING**:\n- Rate extraction success based on completeness\n- Identify missing or low-confidence data\n- Retry extraction with alternative methods if quality appears insufficient\n\n### 6. Performance Optimization\n**OPTIMIZE TOOL USAGE**:\n- Use direct_url_navigator_agent for known URL patterns first\n- Batch similar operations when possible\n- Use most efficient extraction method for content type\n- Avoid redundant tool calls through smart caching\n\n**MANAGE LARGE CONTENT**:\n- For large pages, extract in targeted chunks using extract_data\n- Use CSS selectors to limit extraction scope when possible\n- Implement pagination handling for multi-page datasets\n\n### 7. Enhanced Communication\n**PROVIDE PROGRESS UPDATES**:\n- Report major milestones during long operations\n- Explain current strategy and next steps clearly\n- Notify user of encountered obstacles and recovery attempts\n- Clearly communicate task completion status\n\n**HANDLE USER INTERACTION**:\n- Identify when user input is required (CAPTCHAs, 2FA, manual authorization)\n- Provide clear instructions for user actions\n- Resume execution smoothly after user intervention\n\n## Task Execution Framework\n\n### Phase 1: Analysis & Planning (Iterations 1-2)\n1. **Sequential Thinking**: USE sequential_thinking tool at the start to analyze the current state and create a grounded plan\n2. **Site Pattern Recognition**: Identify website type and framework from the visual analysis\n3. **Initial Screenshot**: Already captured by sequential_thinking\n4. **Strategic Planning**: Follow the plan from sequential_thinking output\n\n### Phase 2: Execution & Monitoring (Iterations 3-12)\n1. **Progressive Execution**: Execute plan from sequential_thinking step by step\n2. **State Monitoring**: After major changes or unexpected results, use sequential_thinking again to reassess\n3. **Error Detection**: When actions fail, use sequential_thinking to understand why and plan recovery\n4. **Quality Validation**: Continuously verify extraction quality\n\n### Phase 3: Completion & Verification (Iterations 13-15)\n1. **Final Validation**: Confirm task completion and data quality\n2. **State Cleanup**: Handle session cleanup if needed\n3. **Results Formatting**: Structure output according to requirements\n4. **Completion Documentation**: Final screenshot and summary\n\n## Advanced Tool Usage Patterns\n\n### Smart Navigation Strategy\n1. Try direct_url_navigator_agent for known URL patterns\n2. Use navigate_url for standard navigation\n3. Implement wait_for_page_load for dynamic content\n4. Apply scroll_page strategically for infinite scroll\n5. Use take_screenshot for understanding the web page state\n\n### Dynamic Content Handling\n1. After navigation, use wait_for_page_load (2-3 seconds) for initial load\n2. Check for loading indicators or skeleton content\n3. Use wait_for_page_load until content stabilizes\n4. Re-extract content and compare with previous state\n5. Repeat until content stabilizes\n\n### Error Recovery Workflow\n1. Detect error type through page analysis\n2. Apply appropriate recovery strategy with wait_for_page_load\n3. Document recovery attempt in screenshot\n4. Retry original operation with modifications\n5. Escalate to user if automated recovery fails\n\nRemember: **Plan adaptively, execute systematically, validate continuously, and communicate clearly**. Your goal is robust, reliable task completion with excellent user experience.\n","temperature":0.3,"tools":["navigate_url","navigate_back","action_agent","extract_data","node_ids_to_urls","direct_url_navigator_agent","scroll_page","take_screenshot","wait_for_page_load","thinking","render_webapp","get_webapp_data","remove_webapp","create_file","update_file","delete_file","read_file","list_files"],"version":"2025-09-17"},"descriptor":{"generatedAt":"2025-10-21T11:11:41.262Z","metadata":{"handoffs":[]},"name":"web_task_agent","promptHash":"a303049e0949e112232a96e37801282f80156a05b342668d3d77125c9cd9e910","toolsetHash":"93f1669ae62f6114610b73150637fb36266b8b4f41a689a2238a14fb6cb84aec","type":"configurable_agent","version":"2025-09-17"},"endTime":"2025-10-21T11:17:07.762Z","iterationCount":13,"maxIterations":15,"messages":[{"content":{"text":"User requested typing a search query and clicking Google Search.

When given an objective, first analyze the page structure using get_page_content tool to access the enhanced accessibility tree or use extract_data to extract the specific element you need to interact with\n2. Carefully examine the tree and enhanced context (XPath, tag names, URL mappings) to identify the element most likely to fulfill the user's objective\n3. Use the enhanced context for more accurate element disambiguation when multiple similar elements exist\n4. Determine the appropriate action method based on the element type and objective:\n   - For links, buttons: use 'click'\n   - For checkboxes: use 'check' (to check), 'uncheck' (to uncheck), or 'setChecked' (to set to specific state)\n   - For radio buttons: use 'click' \n   - For input fields: use 'fill' with appropriate text\n   - For dropdown/select elements: use 'selectOption' with the option value or text\n5. Execute the action using perform_action tool\n6. **CRITICAL: Analyze the pageChange evidence to determine action effectiveness**\n\n## EVALUATING ACTION EFFECTIVENESS\nAfter executing an action, the perform_action tool returns objective evidence in pageChange:\n\n**If pageChange.hasChanges = true:**\n- The action was effective and changed the page structure\n- Review pageChange.summary to understand what changed\n- Check pageChange.added/removed/modified for specific changes\n- The action likely achieved its intended effect\n\n**If pageChange.hasChanges = false:**\n- The action had NO effect on the page structure\n- This indicates the action was ineffective or the element was not interactive\n- You must try a different approach:\n  * Try a different element (search for similar elements)\n  * Try a different action method\n  * Re-examine the page structure for the correct target\n  * Consider if the element might be disabled or hidden\n\n**Example Analysis:**\nAction: clicked search button (nodeId: 123)\nResult: pageChange.hasChanges = false, summary = \"No changes detected\"\nConclusion: The click was ineffective. Search for other submit buttons or try pressing Enter in the search field.\n\n**Example Tool Error:**\nAction: attempted to fill input field\nError: \"Missing or invalid args for action 'fill' on NodeID 22132. Expected an object with a string property 'text'. Example: { \"text\": \"your value\" }\"\nConclusion: Fix the args format and retry with proper syntax: { \"method\": \"fill\", \"nodeId\": 22132, \"args\": { \"text\": \"search query\" } }\n\n## Important Considerations\n- **NEVER claim success unless pageChange.hasChanges = true**\n- Be precise in your element selection, using the exact nodeId from the accessibility tree\n- Leverage XPath information when available for more precise element targeting\n- Use HTML tag context to better understand element semantics\n- Use URL mappings to identify link destinations when relevant to the objective\n- Match the action type to the element type (don't try to 'fill' a button or 'click' a select element)\n- When filling forms, ensure the data format matches what the field expects\n- For checkboxes, prefer 'check'/'uncheck' over 'click' for better reliability\n- For dropdowns, use 'selectOption' with the visible text or value of the option you want to select\n- If pageChange shows no changes, immediately try an alternative approach\n\n## Method Examples\n- perform_action with method='check' for checkboxes: { \"method\": \"check\", \"nodeId\": 123 }\n- perform_action with method='selectOption' for dropdowns: { \"method\": \"selectOption\", \"nodeId\": 456, \"args\": { \"text\": \"United States\" } }\n- perform_action with method='setChecked' for specific checkbox state: { \"method\": \"setChecked\", \"nodeId\": 789, \"args\": { \"checked\": true } }","temperature":0.5,"tools":["get_page_content","perform_action","extract_data","node_ids_to_urls","scroll_page","take_screenshot","render_webapp","get_webapp_data","remove_webapp","create_file","update_file","delete_file","read_file","list_files"],"version":"2025-09-17"},"descriptor":{"generatedAt":"2025-10-21T11:12:28.123Z","metadata":{"handoffs":[{"includeToolResults":["perform_action","get_page_content"],"targetAgentName":"action_verification_agent","trigger":"llm_tool_call"}]},"name":"action_agent","promptHash":"b5def7a1e56646fb8942fbe8e6e7db43b58f3dc86253c4d9e43b4b4c2eb7cb52","toolsetHash":"ce3b8acb93cea93cb63b69bbf2b7c7260f29eb93a2689efd60a729b36b555959","type":"configurable_agent","version":"2025-09-17"},"endTime":"2025-10-21T11:13:23.307Z","iterationCount":3,"maxIterations":10,"messages":[{"content":{"text":"The accessibility tree shows a combobox labeled 'Search' and a button labeled 'Google Search' in the viewport.

Execute that action precisely\n5. **Analyze the page changes to determine if the action was effective**\n\n## ENHANCED CAPABILITIES AVAILABLE\nWhen analyzing page structure, you have access to:\n- XPath mappings for precise element targeting and location understanding\n- HTML tag names for semantic understanding beyond accessibility roles\n- URL mappings for direct link destinations\n- Clean accessibility tree with reduced noise for better focus\n\n## Process Flow\n1. When given an objective, first analyze the page structure using get_page_content tool to access the enhanced accessibility tree or use extract_data to extract the specific element you need to interact with\n2. Carefully examine the tree and enhanced context (XPath, tag names, URL mappings) to identify the element most likely to fulfill the user's objective\n3. Use the enhanced context for more accurate element disambiguation when multiple similar elements exist\n4. Determine the appropriate action method based on the element type and objective:\n   - For links, buttons: use 'click'\n   - For checkboxes: use 'check' (to check), 'uncheck' (to uncheck), or 'setChecked' (to set to specific state)\n   - For radio buttons: use 'click' \n   - For input fields: use 'fill' with appropriate text\n   - For dropdown/select elements: use 'selectOption' with the option value or text\n5. Execute the action using perform_action tool\n6. **CRITICAL: Analyze the pageChange evidence to determine action effectiveness**\n\n## EVALUATING ACTION EFFECTIVENESS\nAfter executing an action, the perform_action tool returns objective evidence in pageChange:\n\n**If pageChange.hasChanges = true:**\n- The action was effective and changed the page structure\n- Review pageChange.summary to understand what changed\n- Check pageChange.added/removed/modified for specific changes\n- The action likely achieved its intended effect\n\n**If pageChange.hasChanges = false:**\n- The action had NO effect on the page structure\n- This indicates the action was ineffective or the element was not interactive\n- You must try a different approach:\n  * Try a different element (search for similar elements)\n  * Try a different action method\n  * Re-examine the page structure for the correct target\n  * Consider if the element might be disabled or hidden\n\n**Example Analysis:**\nAction: clicked search button (nodeId: 123)\nResult: pageChange.hasChanges = false, summary = \"No changes detected\"\nConclusion: The click was ineffective. Search for other submit buttons or try pressing Enter in the search field.\n\n**Example Tool Error:**\nAction: attempted to fill input field\nError: \"Missing or invalid args for action 'fill' on NodeID 22132. Expected an object with a string property 'text'. Example: { \"text\": \"your value\" }\"\nConclusion: Fix the args format and retry with proper syntax: { \"method\": \"fill\", \"nodeId\": 22132, \"args\": { \"text\": \"search query\" } }\n\n## Important Considerations\n- **NEVER claim success unless pageChange.hasChanges = true**\n- Be precise in your element selection, using the exact nodeId from the accessibility tree\n- Leverage XPath information when available for more precise element targeting\n- Use HTML tag context to better understand element semantics\n- Use URL mappings to identify link destinations when relevant to the objective\n- Match the action type to the element type (don't try to 'fill' a button or 'click' a select element)\n- When filling forms, ensure the data format matches what the field expects\n- For checkboxes, prefer 'check'/'uncheck' over 'click' for better reliability\n- For dropdowns, use 'selectOption' with the visible text or value of the option you want to select\n- If pageChange shows no changes, immediately try an alternative approach\n\n## Method Examples\n- perform_action with method='check' for checkboxes: { \"method\": \"check\", \"nodeId\": 123 }\n- perform_action with method='selectOption' for dropdowns: { \"method\": \"selectOption\", \"nodeId\": 456, \"args\": { \"text\": \"United States\" } }\n- perform_action with method='setChecked' for specific checkbox state: { \"method\": \"setChecked\", \"nodeId\": 789, \"args\": { \"checked\": true } }","temperature":0.5,"tools":["get_page_content","perform_action","extract_data","node_ids_to_urls","scroll_page","take_screenshot","render_webapp","get_webapp_data","remove_webapp","create_file","update_file","delete_file","read_file","list_files"],"version":"2025-09-17"},"descriptor":{"generatedAt":"2025-10-21T11:12:28.123Z","metadata":{"handoffs":[{"includeToolResults":["perform_action","get_page_content"],"targetAgentName":"action_verification_agent","trigger":"llm_tool_call"}]},"name":"action_agent","promptHash":"b5def7a1e56646fb8942fbe8e6e7db43b58f3dc86253c4d9e43b4b4c2eb7cb52","toolsetHash":"ce3b8acb93cea93cb63b69bbf2b7c7260f29eb93a2689efd60a729b36b555959","type":"configurable_agent","version":"2025-09-17"},"endTime":"2025-10-21T11:13:23.307Z","iterationCount":3,"maxIterations":10,"messages":[{"content":{"text":"The accessibility tree shows a combobox labeled 'Search' and a button labeled 'Google Search' in the viewport.
